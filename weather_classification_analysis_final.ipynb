    "# Weather Classification Analysis for Wildfire Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "As an Environmental Engineer deeply invested in leveraging data science for environmental recovery, especially in high-risk areas like those prone to wildfires, this project resonates with my core mission. My analytical approach drives me to break down complex environmental challenges into manageable data problems. Here, I apply machine learning to predict dry weather conditions, a critical step in proactive wildfire prevention and resource management. This work is a step-by-step exploration, connecting technical skills with the vital goal of protecting our ecosystems and communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs data preparation, including basic inspection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering, for a weather classification dataset. The goal is to predict dryness trends for wildfire avoidance, with 'Dry' conditions defined based on parameters relevant to the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) system. It also includes statistical tests to understand the relationships between features and dryness.\n"
